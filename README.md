# Rudimentory-Python-Reverse-Shell
A very basic python reverse shell. This could be far better, but it is an older project of mine and it should be written in another language. 
This is run without arguments, I have tested it in python 3.7 but I have not worked on it for a while.


Values need to be manually changed in the .py file in order to have it run correctly.
The attacker is the listening file, and its port number needs to be portforwarded. 
The victim is the connector, it connects to the attacker file.
